# MarchMadnessPredict.
This code developed for the 2020 March Madness Tournament, hoped to rank teams in terms of finding the best teams. Data to make this projection was 
used from last season's tournament (n=63).
Unfortunately I was unable to test this bracket's implementation since this Season's tournament has been cancelled. However, upon testing this model
on previous years, not included in the data-set, this model performed at a rate enough to rank it in the top percentile for previous years.
